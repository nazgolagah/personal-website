Taking inspiration from its home city, Shaya Jewellery introduces Tiger Eye for SS16. An homage to the Tehran skyline, designer Shaya Hosseini has incorporated the graphic lines and abstract shapes of the capital city’s architecture to create a collection which sets a stylish statement for the wearer.

Since founding Shaya Jewellery in 2016, designer Shaya has taken the brand from strength to strength, honing her craft with each collection to create a unique and distinctive style which pushes boundaries in terms of wearability and the materials she uses. AW15 saw the launch of Tiger Eye in yellow gold finish with grey faux-pearls – an instant success that encouraged Leila to expand the collection dramatically for 2016.
